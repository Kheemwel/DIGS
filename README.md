This application was originally made to be use as an offline wiki for disaster survival guide. 
However, I (Lead Developer) wants this app to have more useful purpose, so I add a function that the users can ask help using this application in emergency and also to rescue those people. 
To ask for help, this app enables the bluetooth, so it can be detected by rescuers and also playing an SOS sound or specifically a morse code sound that translates to "Help Me I'm Here". 
This app also uses bluetooth for detecting other users of this app to find and rescue them.
